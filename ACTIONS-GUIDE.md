- Missing details about hyperparameter selection methodology
- Limited discussion of computational complexity and scalability

**Minor Issues**
- Table 2: Caption could be more descriptive
- Several recent papers on interpretability should be cited (see suggestions below)
- Figure 3: Axes labels are too small to read clearly

### Specific Comments
- Page 5, Line 12: The claim about "unprecedented accuracy" needs supporting evidence
- Section 4.1: Consider adding a baseline comparison with simpler methods
- Conclusion: Mention limitations and future work directions

### Recommendation
**Minor Revisions** - The paper is fundamentally sound but needs addressing the methodological gaps and improving clarity in key sections.

### Additional Suggestions

## üîß Enabling Disabled Actions

### Method 1: Plugin Settings (Recommended)
1. Open Obsidian Settings (`Ctrl/Cmd + ,`)
2. Navigate to **Community Plugins**
3. Find **Triple-Crown** in the list
4. Click the gear icon to open plugin settings
5. Scroll to **Actions** section
6. Find the disabled action (will show toggle in OFF position)
7. Click the toggle to enable

### Method 2: Folder Configuration
Create or edit `.claude/config.json` in any folder:

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "enabled": ["writing-assistant", "tag-builder", "therapist-mode"],
    "disabled": []
  }
}
```

### Special Considerations for Therapist Mode

**Why It's Disabled:**
- Processes personal and potentially sensitive content
- Requires explicit user consent
- Best used for private journaling and reflection

**Before Enabling:**
1. Understand that your personal writing will be sent to Claude API
2. Ensure you're comfortable with this level of data sharing
3. Consider using it only in private vaults
4. Review your Anthropic account's data handling policies

**Safe Usage Tips:**
- Use in dedicated journaling notes
- Avoid including real names or identifying information
- Focus on emotions and thoughts rather than specific events
- Remember that Claude is an AI, not a licensed therapist

## üí° Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering for Actions

#### 1. Define the Role Clearly
```
You are a [specific role] who [specific expertise].
```
Good: "You are a technical writer who specializes in API documentation."
Bad: "You are helpful."

#### 2. Specify the Task
```
TASK: [Exact action to perform]
```
Good: "TASK: Convert informal notes into professional email format."
Bad: "Make this better."

#### 3. Provide Guidelines
```
GUIDELINES:
- [Specific rule 1]
- [Specific rule 2]
- [Specific rule 3]
```

#### 4. Define Output Format
```
OUTPUT FORMAT:
[Exact structure with examples]
```

#### 5. Include Examples When Helpful
```
EXAMPLE INPUT:
[Sample input]

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
[Expected output]
```

### Action Design Principles

#### Specificity Over Generality
- ‚úÖ "Convert bullet points to paragraph form"
- ‚ùå "Make this better"

#### Clear Boundaries
- ‚úÖ "Focus only on grammar, preserve all content"
- ‚ùå "Improve this text"

#### Consistent Output
- ‚úÖ Always use the same format structure
- ‚ùå Vary format based on content

#### User Control
- ‚úÖ "Suggest changes, preserve original meaning"
- ‚ùå "Rewrite completely"

### Testing Your Custom Actions

1. **Start Simple**: Test with basic content first
2. **Edge Cases**: Try empty content, very short/long content
3. **Different Contexts**: Test in various types of documents
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
5. **Document**: Note what works and what doesn't

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Action Not Appearing in Command Palette
**Cause**: New custom actions require plugin reload
**Solution**: Restart Obsidian or reload the plugin

#### Action Fails with Error
**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid API key
- Network connectivity issues
- Malformed system prompt

**Solutions**:
1. Check API key in settings
2. Verify internet connection
3. Review system prompt for syntax errors
4. Check plugin console for error details

#### Poor Action Results
**Possible Causes**:
- Vague system prompt
- Insufficient context
- Wrong action for the task

**Solutions**:
1. Make system prompt more specific
2. Provide clearer output format requirements
3. Test with different content types
4. Review successful action examples

#### Custom Action Not Saving
**Cause**: Usually validation errors
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields are filled:
- Action name (unique)
- Description
- System prompt (not empty)

### Getting Help

1. **Check Console**: Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab for error messages
2. **Review Settings**: Verify API configuration
3. **Test Built-in Actions**: Confirm basic functionality works
4. **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs with detailed steps to reproduce

### Performance Tips

1. **Shorter Prompts**: More efficient processing
2. **Specific Requirements**: Reduces back-and-forth
3. **Batch Similar Tasks**: Use actions on multiple files efficiently
4. **Monitor Usage**: Be aware of API costs and rate limits
