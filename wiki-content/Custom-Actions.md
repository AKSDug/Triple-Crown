## ‚öôÔ∏è Managing Custom Actions

### Action Settings

**Enable/Disable Individual Actions**
- Settings ‚Üí Triple-Crown ‚Üí Custom Actions
- Toggle each action on/off
- Disabled actions won't appear in Command Palette

**Delete Actions**
- Click "Delete" button next to any custom action
- Confirmation required
- Action immediately removed from commands

### Organizing Actions

**Use Categories Effectively**
- **Writing**: Text improvement, formatting, style
- **Analysis**: Research, data analysis, synthesis  
- **Organization**: Planning, structuring, categorizing
- **Review**: Quality assessment, feedback, editing
- **Custom**: Specialized or unique use cases

**Naming Conventions**
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include action type: "Grammar Check", "Meeting Formatter"  
- Avoid generic names: "Helper", "Improver"
- Consider alphabetical ordering for easy finding

### Performance Considerations

**Prompt Length**
- Shorter prompts = faster responses
- Be specific but concise
- Use bullet points for guidelines

**Selection Requirements**
- Only require selection if truly necessary
- Whole document processing is more versatile
- Selection-required actions run faster on large docs

**Context Optimization**
```json
{
  "customActions": {
    "maxContextSize": 8000,
    "includeFileMetadata": true,
    "stripFormatting": false
  }
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Custom Actions

### Common Issues

#### Action Not Appearing in Command Palette
**Cause:** Plugin restart required  
**Solution:** Restart Obsidian after creating new actions

#### Poor Action Results
**Possible Causes:**
- Vague system prompt
- Inappropriate content selection
- Missing context information

**Solutions:**
- Make prompts more specific
- Add clear output format requirements  
- Test with different content types
- Review successful action examples

#### Action Takes Too Long
**Causes:**
- Very long documents
- Complex prompts requiring multiple reasoning steps
- Network/API issues

**Solutions:**
- Reduce document size or use selection
- Simplify prompt instructions
- Check internet connection
- Try different Claude model (Haiku for speed)

### Testing Your Actions

#### Development Process
1. **Start simple**: Create basic version first
2. **Test with variety**: Try different content types
3. **Iterate prompts**: Refine based on results
4. **Document learnings**: Note what works/doesn't work

#### Test Cases to Try
- **Empty content**: How does action handle no input?
- **Very short content**: Does it work with minimal text?
- **Very long content**: Performance with large documents?
- **Different formats**: Lists, paragraphs, code blocks?
- **Edge cases**: Unusual formatting, special characters?
