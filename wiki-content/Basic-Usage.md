### What You Get

**Original file (`my-notes.md`):**
```markdown
# My Original Notes

Some content here...

---
**Edited version**: [[my-notes-claude-edit-2024-01-15]]
```

**New file (`my-notes-claude-edit-2024-01-15.md`):**
```markdown
# My Enhanced Notes

~~Some content here...~~ **Enhanced content with better structure and clarity...**

> **Claude's reasoning**: I improved the structure by adding clearer headings, 
> enhanced the flow between paragraphs, and clarified technical concepts for 
> better readability.

## üéØ Quick Action Access

### Command Palette Actions

All actions available via `Ctrl/Cmd + P`:

| Command | Purpose | Requires Selection |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Writing Assistant** | Improve selected text | Optional |
| **Duplicate & Edit** | Improve entire document | No |
| **Generate Tags** | Create relevant tags | No |
| **Find Connections** | Discover note relationships | No |
| **Review Code** | Analyze code blocks | Yes |
| **Academic Peer Review** | Review research content | No |

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Optional)

You can set custom keyboard shortcuts:

1. **Settings** ‚Üí **Hotkeys**
2. **Search for "Triple-Crown"**
3. **Assign shortcuts** to frequently used actions

**Suggested shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + W` - Writing Assistant
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + D` - Duplicate & Edit
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + T` - Open Terminal

## üîç Context Awareness

Triple-Crown automatically provides context to Claude for better results.

### What's Included in Context

1. **Current file content**: The document you're working on
2. **File metadata**: Title, tags, creation date
3. **Linked notes**: Files referenced in the current document
4. **Vault structure**: Understanding of your knowledge organization
5. **Folder configuration**: Local `.claude/config.json` settings

### Context Example

When you ask about a topic, Claude knows:
```
Current file: "Machine Learning Notes.md"
Related files: "AI Fundamentals.md", "Neural Networks.md"
File tags: #ai, #machine-learning, #research
Vault context: Academic research vault with 150 ML-related notes
```

This helps Claude provide:
- **Relevant suggestions** based on your existing notes
- **Consistent terminology** with your other documents
- **Cross-references** to related content
- **Appropriate complexity** for your knowledge level

## üìÅ Folder-Level Behavior

### .claude Configuration

Place `.claude/config.json` in any folder for custom behavior:

```json
{
  "actions": {
    "enabled": ["writing-assistant", "tag-builder"],
    "disabled": ["therapist-mode"]
  },
  "privacy": {
    "neverShare": ["*confidential*", "*private*"],
    "requireConfirmation": true
  }
}
```

### How It Works

- **Folder inheritance**: Subfolders inherit parent folder configs
- **File-specific**: Apply different rules to different areas of your vault
- **Privacy zones**: Create areas where certain actions are disabled
- **Custom prompts**: Different behavior for different projects

4. **Iterate**: Use multiple actions in sequence for complex tasks

### Productivity Tips

2. **Use templates**: Create `.claude/config.json` templates for different projects
3. **Batch similar tasks**: Process multiple similar documents together
4. **Review patterns**: Learn from Claude's suggestions to improve your writing

### Collaboration Tips

1. **Share configs**: Include `.claude/config.json` in shared vaults
2. **Document workflows**: Create notes about your team's Triple-Crown usage
3. **Version control**: Use Duplicate & Edit for collaborative document improvement
4. **Privacy awareness**: Configure privacy settings for shared vaults

## üö® Common Gotchas

### Things to Remember

- **Selection matters**: Some actions work better with specific text selected
- **Context limits**: Very large documents may hit API limits
- **Rate limits**: Anthropic has usage limits - monitor your usage
- **Internet required**: All AI features require internet connection

### Best Practices

- **Save frequently**: Auto-save is enabled but manual saves are good practice
- **Review suggestions**: Claude's suggestions are starting points, not final answers
- **Maintain style**: Use consistent prompting for consistent results
- **Privacy first**: Review what's being shared, especially in sensitive vaults
